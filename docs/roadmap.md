## Spec Implementation Tracking

The C# SDK tracks implementation of MCP spec components using the [modelcontextprotocol project boards](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects), with a dedicated project board for each spec revision. For example, see the [2025-11-25 spec revision board](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects/26).

## Current Focus Areas

### Next Spec Revision

The next MCP specification revision is being developed in the [protocol repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol). The C# SDK already has experimental support for [Tasks](concepts/tasks/tasks.md) (experimental in the specification), which will be updated as the specification is revised.

### Feedback and End-to-End Scenarios

The C# SDK team is actively responding to feedback and continuing to explore end-to-end scenarios for opportunities to add more APIs that implement common patterns.

## Milestones

See the [milestones page](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/milestones) to see which issues and features are being planned for future versions.

## Versioning

For more information about the C# SDK's approach to versioning, breaking changes, and support, see the [Versioning](versioning.md) documentation.
